Original code: http://dotnetspeak.com/2015/06/angular-2-in-visual-studio-2015-with-typescript

This code has been made with the template "HTML Application with TypeScript" of VS 2015 update 1

Error: TS2307 Cannot find module 'angular2/angular2'

The only differences are the .ts file name and .js scripts version. I tried to build with the same versions but doesn't work.
I follow all steps, install typings, AMD module option, the property TypeScriptExperimentalDecorators is true...
