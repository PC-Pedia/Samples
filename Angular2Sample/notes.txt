- Build error: error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/angular2'.
 > Check the angular2 package version. This example use @2.0.0-alpha.52. I tried to build with alpha.53, the last one at this moment, but does not work. In package.json should have the exact dependency "angular2": "2.0.0-alpha.52"
